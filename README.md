# List of common T1 and SO(s) used by Threat groups
- **Application Layer Protocol**: Adversaries use application layer protocols for communication and data transfer within a target network.

- **Boot or Logon Autostart Execution**: This technique involves configuring mechanisms for executing malicious code during system boot or login.

- **Command and Scripting Interpreter**: Adversaries use interpreters to execute commands, scripts, or code on a victim's system.

- **Shortcut Modification**: Modification of shortcut files (.lnk) to execute malicious commands when accessed.

- **Remote File Copy**: Copying files from a remote system to the local system for lateral movement or data exfiltration.

- **Masquerading**: Adversaries attempt to masquerade as legitimate entities or software to evade detection.

- **Obfuscated Files or Information**: Adversaries use obfuscation techniques to hide or protect malicious code, scripts, or other data.

- **Phishing**: Adversaries use phishing emails or messages to deliver malicious payloads or trick victims into revealing sensitive information.

- **Service Stop**: Attackers stop or disable essential services or processes to disrupt or compromise a target system.

- **System Information Discovery**: Adversaries gather information about the target system, such as hardware, software, or network configurations.

- **System Owner/User Discovery**: This technique involves adversaries identifying and gathering information about the system owner or user accounts on a target system.

- **User Execution**: Adversaries rely on user interactions, such as opening malicious attachments or clicking on links, to execute malicious code.

- **Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism**: Attackers exploit mechanisms designed to control privilege elevation to gain higher levels of access.

- **Data from Information Repositories**: Adversaries search for and steal sensitive information stored in information repositories.

- **Signed Binary Proxy Execution**: This technique involves the use of signed binaries to proxy execution of malicious code.

- **System Network Configuration Discovery**: Adversaries gather information about the network configuration of a target system.
